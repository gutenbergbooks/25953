<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>The <i>Kalevala</i>, or the Land of Heroes, as the word may be freely
rendered, is the national epic of Finland, and as that country and its
literature are still comparatively little known to English readers, some
preliminary explanations are here necessary.</p>

<p>On reference to a map of Europe, it will be seen that the north-western
portion of the Russian Empire forms almost a peninsula, surrounded,
except on the Norwegian and Swedish frontiers, by two great arms of the
Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland; the two great
lakes, Ladoga and Onega; the White Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. In the
north of this peninsula is Lapland, and in the south, Finland.</p>

<p>The modern history of Finland begins with the year 1157, when the
country was conquered from the original inhabitants by the Swedes, and
Christianity was introduced. Later on, the Finns became Lutherans, and
are a pious, industrious, and law-abiding people, the upper classes
being highly educated.</p>

<p>During the wars between Sweden and Russia, under Peter the Great and his
successors, much Finnish territory was wrested from Sweden, and St.
Petersburg itself stands on what was formerly Finnish territory. When
what was left of Finland was finally absorbed by Russia in 1809, special
privileges were granted by Alexander I. to the Finns, which his
successors confirmed, and which are highly valued by the people.</p>

<p>The upper classes speak Swedish and Finnish; and the lower classes
chiefly Finnish. Finnish is upheld by many Finns from patriotic motives,
and there is a considerable modern literature in both languages.
Translations of most standard works by English and other authors are
published in Finnish.</p>

<p>The Finns call their country <i>Suomi</i> or Marshland; and it is <span class="pagenum">[Pg. viii]</span>often
spoken of as the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes. The language they speak
belongs to a group called Finnish-Ugrian, or Altaic, and is allied to
Lappish and Esthonian, and more distantly to Turkish and Hungarian,
There are only twenty-one letters in the alphabet; the letter J is
pronounced like Y (as a consonant), and Y almost as a short I. The first
syllable of every word is accented. This renders it difficult to
accommodate such words as <i>K&#x0101;l&#x0115;v&#x0103;i&#x0101;</i> to the metre; but I
have tried to do my best.</p>

<p>The Finlanders are very fond of old ballads, of which a great number
have been collected, especially by Elias L&ouml;nnrot, to whom it occurred to
arrange a selection into a connected poem, to which he gave the name of
<i>Kalevala</i>. This he first published in 1835, in two small volumes
containing twenty-five Runos or Cantos, but afterwards rearranged and
expanded it to fifty Runos; in which form it was published in 1849; and
this was speedily translated into other languages. Perhaps the best
translations are Schiefner's German version (1852) and Collan's Swedish
version (1864). Several volumes of selections and abridgments have also
appeared in America and England; and an English translation by John
Martin Crawford (in two volumes) was published in New York and London in
1889.</p>

<p>Schiefner used a flexible metre for his translation, which resembles the
original as closely as the different character of Finnish and German
would permit, a metre which had previously, though rarely, been used in
English. His work attracted the attention of Longfellow, whose "Song of
Hiawatha" is only a rather poor imitation of Schiefner's version of the
<i>Kalevala</i>, some of the lines being almost identical, and several of the
characters and incidents being more or less distinctly borrowed from
those in the Kalevala. The incidents, however, are generally
considerably altered, and not always for the better.</p>

<p>It will be seen that L&ouml;nnrot edited the <i>Kalevala</i> from old ballads,
much as the poems of Homer, or at least the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, are
said to have been put together by order of Pisistratus.</p>

<p>In the preparation of my own translation, the flexibility of the metre
has permitted me to attempt an almost literal rendering; without, I
hope, sacrificing elegance. The simplicity of <span class="pagenum">[Pg. ix]</span>the Finnish language and
metre would, in my opinion, render a prose version bald and
unsatisfactory. My chief difficulty has been to fit the Finnish names
into even a simple English metre, so as to retain the correct
pronunciation, and I fear I have not always succeeded in overcoming it
satisfactorily. I am greatly indebted to Prof. Kaarle Krohn and Madame
Aino Malmberg of Helsingfors, for their kindness in looking over the
whole of my typewritten translation, and for numerous suggestions and
comments. Of course I am solely responsible for any errors and
shortcomings which may be detected in my work.</p>

<p>I have added short notes at the end of each volume, and a glossary of
proper names at the end of the book, but a detailed commentary would be
out of place in a popular edition. The Arguments to each Runo are
translated, slightly modified, from those in the original.</p>

<p>The religion of the poem is peculiar; it is a Shamanistic animism,
overlaid with Christianity.</p>

<p>The <i>Kalevala</i> relates the history of four principal heroes:
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, the Son of the Wind, and of the Virgin of the Air; a great
culture-hero, patriarch, and minstrel, always described as a vigorous
old man. The Esthonians call him Vanemuine, and make him the God of
Music.</p>

<p>His "brother" Ilmarinen appears to be the son of a human mother, though
he is also said to have been "born upon a hill of charcoal." He is a
great smith and craftsman, and is described as a handsome young man.</p>

<p>The third hero, Lemminkainen, is a jovial, reckless personage, always
getting into serious scrapes, from which he escapes either by his own
skill in magic, or by his mother's. His love for his mother is the
redeeming feature in his character. One of his names is Kaukomieli, and
he is, in part, the original of Longfellow's "Pau-Puk-Keewis."</p>

<p>The fourth hero is Kullervo, a morose and wicked slave of gigantic
strength, which he always misuses. His history is a terrible tragedy,
which has been compared to that of &#338;dipus. He is, in part, the
prototype of Longfellow's "Kwasind." He is the principal hero of the
Esthonian ballads, in which he is called Kalevipoeg, the son of Kaiev
(Kaleva in Finnish), the mythical ancestor of the heroes, who does not
appear in person in the <span class="pagenum">[Pg. x]</span><i>Kalevala</i>. The history of the Kalevipoeg will
be found in my work entitled <i>The Hero of Esthonia</i>, published by Nimmo
in 1895, in two volumes. However, the Esthonians make him not a slave,
but a king. In the <i>Kalevala</i> we meet with no kings, but only
patriarchs, or chiefs of clans.</p>

<p>The principal heroines of the <i>Kalevala</i> are Ilmatar, the Daughter of
the Air, the Creatrix of the world, in the first Runo, whose counterpart
is Marjatta, the mother of the successor of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, in the last
Runo; Aino, a young Lapp girl beloved of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, whose sad fate
forms one of the most pathetic episodes in the <i>Kalevala</i>; Louhi, the
Mistress of Pohjola, or the North Country; and her daughter, afterwards
the wife of Ilmarinen. The character of the daughter of Louhi presents
three phases, which illustrate more than anything else the composite
character of the poem, for it is impossible that any two can have been
drawn by the same hand.</p>

<p>Firstly, we find her as the beautiful and accomplished daughter of the
witch, playing the part of a Medea, without her cruelty.</p>

<p>Secondly, we find her as a timid and shrinking bride, in fact almost a
child-bride.</p>

<p>Thirdly, when married, she appears as a wicked and heartless
peasant-woman of the worst type.</p>

<p>The heroes are all skilled in magic, and to some extent are able to
command or propitiate even the gods. A peculiarity of Finnish magic is
what is called "the word of origin."</p>

<p>To control or banish an evil power, it is sufficient to know and to
repeat to it its proper name, and to relate the history of its creation.</p>

<p>Before concluding the Introduction, it may be well to give a brief
summary of the principal contents of the fifty Runos of the poem.</p>

<p>Runo I. After a preamble by the bard, he proceeds to relate how the
Virgin of the Air descended into the sea, was tossed about by the winds
and waves, modelled the earth, and brought forth the culture-hero
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, who swims to shore.</p>

<p>Runo II. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen clears and plants the country, and sows barley.</p>

<p>Runo III. The Laplander Joukahainen presumes to contend with V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
in singing, but is plunged by him into a <span class="pagenum">[Pg. xi]</span>swamp, till he pledges to him
his sister Aino; after which he is released, and returns home
discomfited. But Aino is much distressed at the idea of being obliged to
marry an old man.</p>

<p>Runo IV. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen makes love to Aino in the forest; but she returns
home in grief and anger, and finally wanders away again, and is drowned
while trying to swim out to some water-nymphs in a lake. Her mother
weeps for her incessantly.</p>

<p>Runo V. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen fishes up Aino in the form of a salmon; but she
escapes him, and his mother advises him to seek a bride in Pohjola, the
North Country, sometimes identified with Lapland, but apparently still
further north.</p>

<p>Runo VI. While V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen is riding over the water on his magic steed,
Joukahainen shoots the horse under him. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen falls into the
water, and is driven onwards by a tempest, while Joukahainen returns to
his mother, who upbraids him for shooting at the minstrel.</p>

<p>Runo VII. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen is carried by an eagle to the neighbourhood of the
Castle of Pohjola, where the chatelaine, Louhi, receives him hospitably,
and offers him her beautiful daughter if he will forge for her the
talisman called the Sampo. He replies that he cannot do so himself, but
will send his brother Ilmarinen, so Louhi gives him a sledge in which to
return home.</p>

<p>Runo VIII. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, on his journey, finds the daughter of Louhi
sitting on a rainbow weaving, and makes love to her. In trying to
accomplish the tasks she sets him, he wounds himself severely, and
drives away till he finds an old man who promises to stanch the blood.</p>

<p>Runo IX. The old man heals V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen by relating the origin of Iron,
and by salving his wounds.</p>

<p>Runo X. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen returns home, and as Ilmarinen declines to go to
Pohjola to forge the Sampo, he causes a whirlwind to carry him to the
castle. Ilmarinen forges the Sampo, but the maiden declines to marry him
at present, and he returns home disconsolate.</p>

<p>Runos XI.-XV. These Runos relate the early adventures of Lemminkainen.
He carries off and marries the beautiful Kyllikki, but quarrels with
her, and starts off to Pohjola to woo the daughter of Louhi. Louhi sets
him various tasks, and at <span class="pagenum">[Pg. xii]</span>length he is slain, cast into the river of
Tuoni, the death-god, and is hewed to pieces; but is rescued and
resuscitated by his mother.</p>

<p>Runos XVI.-XVII. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen regrets having renounced the daughter of
Louhi in favour of Ilmarinen, and begins to build a boat, but cannot
complete it without three magic words, which he seeks for in vain in
Tuonela, the death-kingdom, but afterwards jumps down the throat of the
dead giant, Antero Vipunen, and compels him to sing to him all his
wisdom.</p>

<p>Runos XVIII.-XIX. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen and Ilmarinen travel to Pohjola, one by
water and the other by land, and agree that the maiden shall make her
choice between them. She prefers Ilmarinen, who is aided by his bride to
perform all the tasks set him by Louhi.</p>

<p>Runos XX.-XXV. The wedding is celebrated at Pohjola, an immense ox being
slaughtered for the feast; after which ale is brewed by Osmotar,
"Kaleva's most beauteous daughter." Every one is invited, except
Lemminkainen, who is passed over as too quarrelsome and ill-mannered.
Before the bride and bridegroom leave, they have to listen to long
lectures about their future conduct.</p>

<p>Runos XXVI.-XXX. Lemminkainen is enraged at not being invited to the
wedding, forces his way into the Castle of Pohjola through the magical
obstacles in his path, and slays the lord of the castle in a duel. He
flies home, and his mother sends him to hide in a distant island where
all the warriors are absent, and where he lives with the women till the
return of the men, when he is again obliged to fly. He returns home, and
finds the whole country laid waste, and only his mother in hiding.
Against her advice, he persuades his old comrade Tiera to join him in
another expedition against Pohjola, but Louhi sends the Frost against
them, and they are driven back in great distress.</p>

<p>Runos XXXI.-XXXVI. A chief named Untamo lays waste the territory of his
brother Kalervo, and carries off his wife. She gives birth to Kullervo,
who vows vengeance against Untamo in his cradle. Untamo brings Kullervo
up as a slave, but as he spoils everything he touches, sells him to
Ilmarinen. <span class="pagenum">[Pg. xiii]</span>Ilmarinen's wife ill-treats him, and he revenges himself by
giving her over to be devoured by wolves and bears, and escapes to the
forests, where he rejoins his family. One of his sisters has been lost,
and meeting her accidentally and without knowing her, he carries her
off. She throws herself into a torrent, and he returns home. His mother
advises him to go into hiding, but first he makes war on Untamo,
destroys him and his clan, and again returns home. Here he finds all his
people dead, and everything desolate; so he wanders off into the forest,
and falls on his own sword.</p>

<p>Runos XXXVII.-XLIX. Ilmarinen forges himself a new wife of gold and
silver, but cannot give her life or warmth, so he carries off another
daughter of Louhi; but she angers him so much that he changes her into a
seagull. Ilmarinen and V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, who are afterwards joined by
Lemminkainen, now undertake another expedition to Pohjola to carry off
the Sampo. On the way, V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen constructs a kantele or harp of
pikebone, and lulls Louhi and her people to sleep; but she pursues the
robbers, and first the kantele is lost overboard, and then the Sampo is
broken to pieces and lost in the sea. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen saves enough to secure
the prosperity of Kalevala, but Louhi only carries home a small and
almost useless fragment. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen then makes a new kantele of
birchwood. Louhi brings pestilence on Kalevala, then sends a bear
against the country, and lastly, steals away the sun and moon, hiding
them in the stone mountain of Pohjola. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen drives away the
plagues, kills the bear, and renews fire from a conflagration caused by
a spark sent down from heaven by the god Ukko. Ilmarinen then prepares
chains for Louhi, and terrifies her into restoring the sun and moon to
their original places.</p>

<p>Runo L. The virgin Marjatta swallows a cranberry, and brings forth a
son, who is proclaimed King of Carelia. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen in great anger quits
the country in his boat, but leaves the kantele and his songs behind him
for the pleasure of the people.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the Finnish language, I quote the original text of a

<p>The <i>Kalevala</i> is very unlike any poem familiar to general readers, but
it contains much that is extremely curious and interesting; and many
beautiful passages and episodes which are by no means inferior to those
we find in the ballad-literature of better-known countries than Finland.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Prelude (1-102). The Virgin of the Air descends into the sea, where she
is fertilized by the winds and waves and becomes the Water-Mother
(103-176). A teal builds its nest on her knee, and lays eggs (177-212).
The eggs fall from the nest and break, but the fragments form the earth,
sky, sun, moon and clouds (213-244). The Water-Mother creates capes,
bays, sea-shores, and the depths and shallows of the ocean (245-280).
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen is born from the Water-Mother, and is tossed about by the
waves for a long time until he reaches the shore (281-344).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen lands on a treeless country and directs Sampsa Pellervoinen
to sow trees (1-42). At first the oak will not grow, but after repeated
sowings it springs up, overshadows the whole country, and hides the sun
and moon (43-110). A little man rises from the sea, who fells the oak,
and permits the sun and moon to shine again (111-224). Birds sing in the
trees; herbs, flowers and berries grow on the ground; only the barley
will not spring up (225-256). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen finds some barleycorns in the
sand on the shore, and fells the forest, leaving only a birch-tree as a
resting-place for the birds (257-264). The eagle, grateful for this,
strikes fire, and the felled trees are consumed (265-284). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
sows the barley, prays to Ukko for its increase, and it grows and
flourishes (285-378).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen increases in wisdom and composes songs (1-20). Joukahainen
sets out to contend with him in wisdom; but as he cannot overcome him,
he challenges him to a duel, whereupon V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen grows angry, and
sinks him in a swamp by his magic songs (21-330). Joukahainen, in great
distress, finally offers his sister Aino in marriage to V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, who
accepts the offer and releases him (331-476). Joukahainen returns home
discomfited, and relates his misfortunes to his mother (477-524). The
mother rejoices at the prospect of such an alliance, but the daughter
laments and weeps (525-580).</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen meets Aino in the wood and addresses her (1-20). Aino
hurries home weeping, and informs her mother (21-116). Her mother
forbids her to weep, and tells her to rejoice, and to adorn herself
handsomely (117-188). Aino continues to weep, and declares that she will
never take a very old man as her husband (189-254). She wanders
sorrowfully into the wild woods, and reaches the banks of a strange
unknown lake, where she goes to bathe, and is lost in the water
(255-370). The animals commission the hare to carry the tidings of
Aino's death to her home (371-434). Her mother weeps for her night and
day (435-518).</p>

<p>Joukahainen cherishes hatred against V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen and lies in wait for
him on his journey to Pohjola (1-78). He sees him riding past and shoots
at him, but only kills his horse (79-182). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen falls into the
water and is driven out to sea by a tempest, while Joukahainen rejoices,
because he thinks he has at last overcome V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen (183-234).</p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen swims for several days on the open sea (1-88). The eagle,
grateful to him for having spared the birch-tree for him to rest on,
when he was felling the trees takes V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen on his wings, and
carries him to the borders of Pohjola, where the Mistress of Pohjola
takes him to her abode, and receives him hospitably (89-274).
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen desires to return to his own country, and the Mistress of
Pohjola permits him to depart, and promises him her daughter in marriage
if he will forge the Sampo in Pohjola (275-322). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen promises
that when he returns home he will send the smith Ilmarinen to forge the
Sampo, and the Mistress of Pohjola gives him a horse and a sledge to
convey him home (323-368).</p>

<p>On his journey V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen encounters the magnificently-clad Maiden of
Pohja, and makes advances to her (1-50). The maiden at length consents
to his wishes if he will make a boat from the splinters of her spindle,
and move it into the water without touching it (51-132). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
sets to work, but wounds his knee severely with his axe, and cannot
stanch the flow of blood (133-204). He goes in search of some magic
remedy and finds an old man who promises to stop the bleeding (205-282).</p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen repeats to the old man the legend of the origin of iron
(1-266). The old man reviles the iron and repeats spells for the
stopping of blood, and the flow of blood is stayed (267-416). The old
man directs his son to prepare a salve, and dresses and binds up the
wound. V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen is cured, and thanks Jumala for his merciful
assistance (417-586).</p>

where he is very well received, and promises to forge a Sampo (201-280).
He forges the Sampo, and the Mistress of Pohjola conceals it in the
Rocky Mountain of Pohjola (281-432). Ilmarinen asks for the maiden as
his reward, but she makes excuses, saying that she is not yet ready to
leave home (433-462). Ilmarinen receives a boat, returns home, and
informs V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen that he has forged the Sampo in Pohjola (463-510).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Lemminkainen goes to seek a wife among the noble maidens of Saari
(1-110). At first they laugh at him, but afterwards become very friendly
(111-156). But Kyllikki, on whose account he has come, will not listen
to him, and at length, he carries her off by force, drags her into his
sledge, and drives away with her (157-222). Kyllikki weeps, and
especially reproaches Lemminkainen with his fondness for war, and
Lemminkainen promises not to go to war if Kyllikki promises never to go
to the village dances, and both swear to observe these conditions
(223-314). Lemminkainen drives home, and mother rejoices in her young
daughter-in-law (315-402).</p>

<p>Kyllikki forgets her oath and goes to the village, whereupon
Lemminkainen is enraged and resolves to divorce her immediately, and to
set forth to woo the Maiden of Pohja (1-128). His mother does her utmost
to dissuade him, telling him that he will very probably be killed.
Lemminkainen, who is brushing his hair, throws the brush angrily out of
his hand and declares that blood shall flow from the brush if he should
come to harm (129-212). He makes ready, starts on his journey, comes to
Pohjola, and sings all the men out of the homestead of Pohjola; and only
neglects to enchant one wicked cowherd (213-504).</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Lemminkainen invokes the forest deities, and at length succeeds in
capturing the elk, and brings it to Pohjola (1-270). Another task is
given him, to bridle the fire-breathing steed of Hiisi. He bridles it
and brings it to Pohjola (271-372). A third task is assigned him, to
shoot a swan on the river of Tuonela, Lemminkainen comes to the river,
but the despised cowherd, who is lying in wait for him, kills him, and
casts his body into the cataract of Tuoni. The son of Tuoni then cuts
his body to pieces (373-460).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>One day blood begins to trickle from the hair-brush at Lemminkainen's
home, and his mother at once perceives that death has overtaken her son.
She hastens to Pohjola and inquires of Louhi what has become of him
(1-100). The Mistress of Pohjola at length tells her on what errand she
has sent him, and the sun gives her full information of the manner of
Lemminkainen's death (101-194). Lemminkainen's mother goes with a long
rake in her hand under the cataract of Tuoni, and rakes the water till
she has found all the fragments of her son's body, which she joins
together, and succeeds in restoring Lemminkainen to life by charms and
magic salves (195-554). Lemminkainen then relates how he perished in the
river of Tuonela, and returns home with his mother (555-650).</p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen orders Sampsa Pellervoinen to seek for wood for
boat-building. He makes a boat, but finds himself at a loss for want of
three magic words (1-118). As he cannot otherwise obtain them, he goes
to Tuonela hoping to procure them there (119-362). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen finally
escapes from Tuonela, and after his return warns others not to venture
there, and describes what a terrible place it is and the horrible abodes
in which men dwell there (363-412).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen goes to obtain magic words from Antero Vipunen, and wakes
him from his long sleep under the earth (1-98). Vipunen swallows
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, and the latter begins to torture him violently in his
stomach (99-146). Vipunen tries every means that he can think of to get
rid of him by promises, spells, conjurations and exorcisms, but
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen declares that he will never depart till he has obtained from
Vipunen the words which he requires to finish his boat (147-526).
Vipunen sings all his wisdom to V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, who then leaves his body,
returns to his boat-building, and finishes his boat (527-6:28).</p>

<p>V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen sets sail in his new boat to woo the Maiden of Pohja (1-40).
Ilmarinen's sister sees him, calls to him from the shore, learns the
object of his journey, and hastens to warn her brother that a rival has
set forth to Pohjola to claim the bride (41-266). Ilmarinen makes ready,
and rides on horseback to Pohjola along the shore (267-470). The
Mistress of Pohjola sees the suitors approaching, and advises her
daughter to choose V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen (471-634). But the daughter herself
prefers Ilmarinen, the forger of the Sampo, and tells V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, who
is first to arrive, that she will not marry him (635-706).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Argument</i></p>

<p>Ilmarinen arrives at the homestead of Pohjola, woos the daughter of the
house, and perilous tasks are assigned to him (1-32). Aided by the
advice of the Maiden of Pohja he succeeds in performing the tasks
successfully. Firstly, he ploughs a field of serpent, secondly, he
captures the Bear of Tuoni and the Wolf of Manala, and thirdly, he
captures a large and terrible pike in the river of Tuonela (33-344). The
Mistress of Pohjola promises and betroths her daughter to Ilmarinen
(345-498). V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen returns from Pohjola in low spirits, and warns
every one against going wooing in company with a younger man (499-518).</p>

<p>The bridegroom is instructed how he should behave towards his bride, and
is cautioned not to treat her badly (1-264). An old beggar relates how
he once brought his wife to reason (265-296). The bride remembers with
tears that she is now quitting her dear birthplace for the rest of her
life, and says farewell to all (297-462). Ilmarinen lifts his bride into
the sledge and reaches his home on the evening of the third day
(463-528).</p>

<p>The bride, the bridegroom and their company are received at the home of
Ilmarinen (1-382). The company are hospitably entertained with food and
drink: and V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen sings the praises of the host, the hostess, the
inviter, the bridesmaid, and the other wedding-guests (383-672). On the
way back V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen's sledge breaks down, but he repairs it, and drives
home (673-738).</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES_TO_RUNOS_I-XXV" id="NOTES_TO_RUNOS_I-XXV"></a>NOTES TO RUNOS I-XXV</h2>

<p>(These are by the translator, when not otherwise stated. K. K.
indicates Prof. Kaarle Krohn, and A. M. Madame Aino Malmberg,
For proper names, refer to the Glossary at the end of Vol. II.)</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO I</p>

<p><a href="#r1-11">11.</a> Kulta, "golden," here rendered "dearest," is a term constantly
applied in the <i>Kalevala</i> to anything dear or precious.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-20">20.</a> "Pohja, the North, or Pohjola, the North Land, is chiefly used
for the dark North, where the sun is hidden. Poetically used for a
homestead in the <i>Kalevala</i>. Occasionally it is used as synonymous
with Lapland." (K. K.)</p>

<p><a href="#r1-21">21.</a> When singing to the accompaniment of a harp, two Finns clasp their
hands together, and sway backwards and forwards, in the manner described
in the text. Compare Acerbi's <i>Travels to the North Cape</i>, I.,
chaps. xx. and xxiii., and the illustration opposite his Vol. I., p.
226.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-61">61.</a> Probably the honey of humble-bees (<i>Bombus</i>) is here meant, or
the expression may be merely figurative.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-63">63, 64.</a> The metre allows the translation of the names of the cows to
be inserted here.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-110">110.</a> Ilmatar, the Daughter of the Air; &mdash;tar is the usual feminine
suffix in Finnish, and is generally to be understood to mean "daughter
of &mdash;&mdash;." In the following passages we have the combined Finnish version
of the widespread cosmogonical myths of the Divine Spirit brooding
over the waters of Chaos; and the Mundane Egg. In the First Recension
of the <i>Kalevala</i> however, and in many Finnish ballads, an eagle is
said to have built her nest on the knees of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen after he was
thrown into the sea by the Laplander, and the Creation-Myth is thus
transferred to him.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-229">229-244.</a> In the Scandinavian Mythology the world was created in
a similar manner by Othin and his brothers from the body of the giant
Ymir.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-289">289.</a> Vaka vanha V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen&mdash;these are the usual epithets applied
to V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen in the Kalevala. "Vanha" means old; "vaka" is
variously interpreted: I have used "steadfast" by Prof. Krohn's
advice, though I think "lusty" might be a better rendering.</p>

<p><a href="#r1-320">320.</a> The ring-finger is usually called the "nameless finger" in
Finnish.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO II</p>

<p><a href="#r2-27">27.</a> The Bird Cherry (<i>Prunus Padus</i>).</p>

<p><a href="#r2-29">29.</a> The Mountain Ash, or Rowan Tree, is a sacred tree in Finland,
as in Scotland.</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 320]</div>
<p><a href="#r2-83">83.</a> The Great Oak-tree is a favourite subject in Finnish and Esthonian
ballads.</p>

<p><a href="#r2-117">117.</a> Finnish, and Esthonian water-heroes are sometimes described as
entirely composed of copper.</p>

<p><a href="#r2-211">211.</a> Compare the account of the breaking up of the Sampo, and the
dispersal of its fragments, in Runo XLIII.</p>

<p><a href="#r2-245">245.</a> The summer ermine is the stoat, which turns white in winter in
the North, when it becomes the ermine. The squirrel also turns grey
in the North in winter.</p>

<p><a href="#r2-376">376.</a> The cuckoo is regarded as a bird of good omen.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO III</p>

<p><a href="#r3-15">15.</a> We here find V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, the primeval minstrel and culture-hero,
the first-born of mortals, living in an already populated world.
There seems to be a similar discrepancy in Gen. IV. 14-17</p>

<p><a href="#r3-35">35.</a> Women were held in great respect in heroic times in most
Northern countries.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-58">58.</a> "I will bewitch him who tries to bewitch me." (K. K.)</p>

<p><a href="#r3-72">72.</a> A gold-adorned, or perhaps merely handsome, sledge.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-154">154.</a> Probably another epithet for the seal.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-156">156.</a> The powan, or fresh-water herring (<i>Coregonus</i>), of which there
are several marine and fresh-water species. They are chiefly lake-fish
of the Northern Hemisphere, and in the British Islands are better
known in Scotland and Ireland, and in the North of England, than in
the South.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-168">168.</a> The word used here may also mean the elk or ox.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-230">230.</a> The Arch of Heaven in the <i>Kalevala</i> means the rainbow.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-231">231, 232.</a> The Sun and Moon are male deities in Finnish, with sons
and daughters.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-233">233.</a> The constellation of the Great Bear.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-273">273.</a> Most of the heroes of the <i>Kalevala</i>, except Kullervo, have
black hair, and the heroines, except the wife of Ilmarinen, golden
hair.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-411">411, 412.</a> A common ransom in Finnish and Esthonian stories.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-459">459.</a> The episode of Aino is a great favourite in Finland, and the
name is in common use. The story often furnishes material to poets,
sculptors, etc.</p>

<p><a href="#r3-533">533.</a> Different stories are told of the origin of both V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen and
Ilmarinen, and they are often called brothers.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO IV</p>

<p><a href="#r4-4">4.</a> Bath-whisks are used to heighten the circulation after bathing.
"The leaves are left on the stems. The bath-whisks for the winter
are all made early in the summer, when the leaves are softest. Of
course they become quite dry, but before using, they are steeped in hot
water till they become soft and fragrant." (A. M.)</p>

<p><a href="#r4-75">75.</a> "The storehouses where the peasant girls keep their clothes and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 321]</span>
ornaments are sometimes very pretty, and the girls always sleep there
in summer. There are other storehouses for food." (A. M.)</p>

<p><a href="#r4-121">121.</a> According to Speke, Central African women are compelled to
drink large quantities of milk, to make them inordinately fat, which is
considered a great beauty.</p>

<p><a href="#r4-206">206.</a> <i>Fuligala glacialis.</i></p>

<p><a href="#r4-295">295.</a> Prof. Krohn thinks the sea and not a lake is here intended.</p>

<p><a href="#r4-308">308.</a> This passage is hardly intelligible. "I have heard some people
suggest that Aino perhaps took a birch branch, to be used as a
bath-whisk." (A. M.)</p>

<p><a href="#r4-377">377.</a> There are many popular tales in Finnish relating to animals,
especially the bear, wolf, and fox, but this is the only illustration of
the true "beast-epos" in the <i>Kalevala</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#r4-413">413.</a> "The sauna, or bath-house, is always a separate building; and
there Finnish people take extremely hot baths almost every evening."
(A. M.) It is also used for confinements.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO V</p>

<p><a href="#r5-220">220.</a> Here a human mother, rather than Ilmatar, seems to be
ascribed to V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen. Visits to parents' graves for advice and
assistance are common in Scandinavian and Esthonian literature.
Commentators have also quoted the story of Achilles and Thetis, but
this is hardly a parallel case.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO VI</p>

<p><a href="#r6-120">120.</a> This passage is again inconsistent with the legend of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
being the son of Ilmatar.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO VII</p>

<p><a href="#r7-19">19.</a> The word used here is "poika," which literally means a boy, or
a son.</p>

<p><a href="#r7-51">51, 52.</a> The original admirably expresses the hovering motion of the
bird:</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lenteleikse, liiteleikse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Katseleikse, kaanteleikse.</span><br />
</div>

<p><a href="#r7-142">142.</a> In the original "the song of a cock's child."</p>

<p><a href="#r7-177">177, 178.</a> Weeping appears no more disgraceful to the heroes of the
<i>Kalevala</i> than to those of the <i>Iliad</i>. Still, V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen
not unfrequently plays a very undignified part when in difficulties.</p>

<p><a href="#r7-241">241.</a> Louhi recognized him, though he would not mention his name.</p>

<p><a href="#r7-286">286.</a> "Virsu is a shoe made of birch bark." (A. M.)</p>

<p><a href="#r7-311">311.</a> It appears that the magic mill called a Sampo could only be
forged by a competent smith, from materials which Louhi alone possessed,
and which, perhaps, she could not again procure. Otherwise
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 322]</span>
Ilmarinen could have forged another for himself, and it would have
been unnecessary for the heroes to steal it. The chain forged by the
dwarfs, according to the Prose Edda, for binding the wolf Fenrir, was
also composed of materials which could not again be procured. "It
was fashioned out of six things; to wit, the noise made by the footfall
of a cat, the beards of women, the roots of stones, the sinews of
bears, the breath of fish, and the spittle of birds."</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO VIII</p>

<p><a href="#r8-3">3, 4.</a> The daughter of Louhi is never mentioned again in connection
with the rainbow; and it is quite incorrect to call her the Maiden of
the Rainbow, as some writers have done, for no such title is ever
applied to her in the poem.</p>

<p><a href="#r8-35">35.</a> There are so many instances of maidens being carried off, or
enticed into sledges, in the <i>Kalevala</i>, that it seems almost to have
been a recognized legal form of marriage by capture.</p>

<p><a href="#r8-57">57.</a> Finnish magicians profess to understand the language of birds;
but the passage in the text is probably intended only in jest.</p>

<p><a href="#r8-152">152.</a> In the Icelandic saga of Grettir, the hero mortally wounds
himself in the leg while trying to chop up a piece of driftwood on which
a witch had laid her curse.</p>

<p><a href="#r8-179">179.</a> The Finns supposed that if the origin of any hostile agent was
known, and could be recited to it, its power for evil was at an end. In
Denmark, the naming of any person or thing was an evil omen, and
liable to bring about its destruction.</p>

<p><a href="#r8-217">217, 218.</a> Finnish hamlets are sometimes built on a hillside in the
manner described.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO IX</p>

<p><a href="#r9-35">35, 36.</a> Here we seem to have an allusion to the first chapter of
Genesis.</p>

<p><a href="#r9-44">44.</a> The same epithet, Luonnotar, is sometimes applied to Ilmatar,
and thus V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen might literally be called the brother of Iron.</p>

<p><a href="#r9-111">111, 112.</a> Pallas Athene sprang armed from the brain of Zeus;
Karna, in India, the son of the Sun, was born with armour and earrings;
and Mexitli in Mexico was born with a spear in his hand.</p>

<p><a href="#r9-231">231.</a> Hornets often build their nests under the eaves of houses.</p>

<p><a href="#r9-242">242.</a> Both frogs and toads exude a more or less poisonous secretion
from the skin.</p>

<p><a href="#r9-433">433.</a> Honeydew seems to be meant here.</p>

<p><a href="#r9-525">525, 526.</a> An imaginary mountain to which the sorcerers professed
to be able to banish pain and sickness.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO X</p>

<p><a href="#r10-306">306.</a> Compare the account of the forging of the Gold and Silver
Bride in Runo XXXVII.</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 323]</div>
<p><a href="#r10-311">311.</a> "Ilmarinen first employs ordinary servants, and then calls the
winds to his assistance." (K. K.)</p>

<p><a href="#r10-331">331.</a> In the Icelandic sagas, we read of the sword Tyrfing, forged by
dwarfs, which, if ever drawn, could not again be sheathed till it had
slain at least one victim.</p>

<p><a href="#r10-332">332.</a> Literally, "on best days."</p>

<p><a href="#r10-414">414.</a> In the story of Ala Ed-Deen Abush-Shamat, in the <i>1001 Nights</i>,
we read of a magic bead with five facets, on which were engraved a
camel, an armed horseman, a pavilion; a couch, etc., according to the
use intended to be made of each facet.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XI</p>

<p><a href="#r11-31">31-42.</a> Salme and Linda are similarly wooed by the Sun, the
Moon, and a Star in the Esthonian poem, Kalevipoeg (see Kirby's <i>Hero
of Esthonia</i> I., pp. 10-15).</p>

<p><a href="#r11-264">264-266.</a> These names mean respectively Blackies, Strawberries,
Cranberries. "I think Lemminkainen means that he has no cows,
and only calls these different berries his cows." (A. M.)</p>

<p><a href="#r11-306">306.</a> Lemminkainen appears to have been afraid that some one else
might carry off his wife, if she showed herself in public (especially
Untamo, says Prof. Krohn).</p>

<p><a href="#r11-385">385.</a> The Snow Bunting (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>), a white bird more
or less varied with black.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XII</p>

<p><a href="#r12-25">25.</a> The meaning is a little uncertain. Literally, "the only boy,"
as Madame Malmberg suggests. The commentary renders it, "the
gallant youth."</p>

<p><a href="#r12-93">93.</a> The Finns and Lapps often hide money in the ground.
The word used in l. 94 is "penningin," from "penni," a word
common to most Teutonic and Northern languages.</p>

<p><a href="#r12-211">211, 212.</a> Such omens of death are common in fairy tales; as, for
instance, the bleeding knives in the story of the Envious Sisters in the
<i>1001 Nights</i>. The bleeding trees in medi&aelig;val romance belong to
rather a different category of ideas.</p>

<p><a href="#r12-233">233.</a> Lemminkainen seems to have hidden himself to escape further
remonstrances from his mother and Kyllikki.</p>

<p><a href="#r12-262">262.</a> Probably a creature like a kelpie or Phooka.</p>

<p><a href="#r12-474">474.</a> We are not told how Louhi escaped; but she seems to have
come to no harm.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XIII</p>

<p><a href="#r13-105">105.</a> The part played by Hiisi in the <i>Kalevala</i> usually resembles
that played by Loki in the Scandinavian Mythology.</p>

<div class="pagenum">[Pg. 324]</div>
<p><a href="#r13-109">109.</a> Animals, etc., are often thus constructed in Finnish, Esthonian,
and Siberian mythology by gods, demons, and magicians. They do not
seem able to create from nothing, but to manufacture what they please
or what they can from pre-existing materials, however incongruous.</p>

<p><a href="#r13-111">111.</a> I suppose rushes are here intended.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XIV</p>

<p><a href="#r14-33">33.</a> The word here translated "islands" properly means a wooded
hill surrounded by marshland.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-47">47, 48.</a> Mielikki's gold and silver are the spoils of the chase.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-69">69.</a> Honey is sometimes used in the <i>Kalevala</i> for anything sweet and
agreeable, just as golden is used for anything beautiful.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-103">103, 104.</a> It appears that the hunter's fortune in the chase was
foretold by the rich or shabby garments worn by the forest-deities.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-142">142.</a> Finnish women often wear a blouse over their other garments.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-216">216.</a> Kuningas (king) is a Teutonic word, which rarely occurs in the
<i>Kalevala</i>. The heroes are patriarchs, or chiefs of clans; not
kings, as in Homer.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-248">248.</a> There is often much confusion of terms in the <i>Kalevala</i>. The
creature here mentioned is generally called an elk, but often a reindeer,
and in this line a camel-foal.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-304">304.</a> When the inferior deities are deaf or too weak, the heroes appeal
to the higher Gods.</p>

<p><a href="#r14-305">305.</a> The reference here seems to be to Gen. vii. 11. "The whole

<p class="center">RUNO XV</p>

<p><a href="#r15-7">7.</a> Compare Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, III., 311-314.</p>

<p><a href="#r15-240">240.</a> This episode slightly resembles the story of Isis and Osiris.</p>

<p><a href="#r15-498">498.</a> The constellation of Orion is variously called by the Finns, the
Moonshine, the Sword of Kaleva, and the Scythe of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen.</p>

<p><a href="#r15-559">559-562.</a> This conceit is common in fairy tales (especially in Russian
ones) in the case of heroes wakened from the dead. Sometimes it takes
a comic form; and sometimes, as in the present case, a pathetic one.</p>

<p><a href="#r15-617">617.</a> "Dirty-nosed" is a common opprobrious expression in Esthonia.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XVI</p>

<p><a href="#r16-27">27.</a> The account of the boat-building in "Hiawatha's Sailing" is
evidently imitated from this passage.</p>

<p><a href="#r16-128">128.</a> In Roman times divination from birds was chiefly taken from
their flight or feeding.</p>

<p class="center">RUNO XVII</p>

<p><a href="#r17-20">20.</a> Roads of this description are thoroughly Oriental in character.</p>

<p><a href="#r17-86">86.</a> In Icelandic sagas we often find heroes roused from their graves,
but this is usually attempted in order to obtain a sword which has been
buried with them.</p>

<p><a href="#r17-93">93-104.</a> Hiawatha was also swallowed by the sturgeon Nahma,
but the circumstances were quite different.</p>

<p><a href="#r17-211">211.</a> Note the resonance of the line:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kuusista kuhisevista.</span></p>

<p><a href="#r17-237">237.</a> Ahava, a dry cold wind that blows in March and April,
probably corresponding to our cold spring east wind.</p>

<p><a href="#r17-285">285, 286.</a> Vipunen here refers to himself as a little man, which I
presume is to be understood figuratively, as I have rendered it.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XVIII</p>

<p><a href="#r18-379">379.</a> Compare Cuchullain's wooing of Eimer in Irish story.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XIX</p>

<p><a href="#r19-33">33.</a> This episode is very like the story of Jason and Medea.</p>

<p><a href="#r19-210">210.</a> "The wolf Fenrir opens his enormous mouth; the lower jaw
reaches to the earth, and the upper one to heaven, and would in fact
reach still further were there space to admit of it." (Prose Edda.)</p>

<p><a href="#r19-217">217.</a> Vetehinen, a water-spirit.</p>

<p><a href="#r19-311">311.</a> "Ukko's bow" here means the rainbow, broken by the fiery
eagle. It may be worth noting that in the Scandinavian Mythology, the
sons of Fire (Muspell) are to ride over the rainbow, and break it to
pieces, on their way to battle with the gods.</p>

<p><a href="#r19-483">483.</a> In the Danish Ballads there are several stories of children
speaking in their cradles, but generally to vow vengeance against an
enemy.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XX</p>

<p><a href="#r20-17">17.</a> The Great Ox is a stock subject in Finnish and Esthonian ballad
literature.</p>

<p class="center">RUNO XXI</p>

<p><a href="#r21-161">161.</a> The Glutton or wolverine, a well-known animal in sub-Arctic
Europe, Asia, and America.</p>

<p><a href="#r21-182">182-186.</a> These civilities sound very Oriental.</p>

<p><a href="#r21-393">393.</a> This curious passage may have been partly suggested by the
"coats of skin," and "the land flowing with milk and honey" of the
Old Testament.</p>

<p class="center">RUNO XXII</p>

<p><a href="#r22-76">76.</a> The word used here for father Is taatto, which curiously recalls
the Welsh tad. (English, dad.)</p>

<p><a href="#r22-194">194.</a> In the Scandinavian Mythology the giantess Skadi was required
to choose a husband from among the gods by looking at their feet only.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XXIII</p>

<p><a href="#r23-330">330.</a> The usual word to express a long time is viikko, a week.</p>

<p><a href="#r23-469">469, 470.</a> These infernal damsels play various parts in the <i>Kalevala</i>,
as boat-women, death-bringers, etc., and here we find them in the
character of Furies.</p>

<p><a href="#r23-487">487.</a> The term "snowy month" is used for the period between Feb.
20 and March 20. I have rendered it March.</p>

<p><a href="#r23-787">787-792.</a> Perhaps this is only figurative, as in the case of the
unpropitious forest-deities.</p>

<p class="center">RUNO XXIV</p>

<p><a href="#r24-119">119.</a> The roots of the marsh arum (<i>Calla palustris</i>), not a British
plant, though naturalized in a pond at Ripley. The most usual substitute
for more wholesome food in times of famine is bread composed of a
mixture of fir-bark and rye.</p>

<p><a href="#r24-240">240.</a> Slav peasant women are said sometimes to regard beating as a sign
of affection on the part of their husbands, but this does not seem to be
the case with the Finns. In the <i>Kalevala</i> we read a good deal
about wife-beating in theory, but find very little of it in practice;
and even the licentious and violent Lemminkainen never thinks of beating
his wife when he quarrels with her.</p>

<p><a href="#r24-279">279-296.</a> A similar story is told to the Princess by her confidante
Olga, in the Russian opera <i>Rusalka</i> (water-nymph), Act III. scene i.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"And now I'd better sing a little song:</span><br />
<span class="i0">As they passed in our street,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A man besought his wife,</span><br />

<p><a href="#r24-446">446, 450, 454.</a> The commentary explains the word used here to
mean "wander round thee," an alteration which I consider unnecessary
except in the last line.</p>

<p><a href="#r24-467">467.</a> From the sarcastic tone of this speech, Ilmarinen seems to have
been quite tired and disgusted with all the fuss, in which most of our
readers will probably sympathize with him.</p>

<hr class="section hidden" />
<p class="center">RUNO XXV</p>

<p><a href="#r25-47">47.</a> According to popular usage, a son is ennobled by being called a
brother.</p>

<p><a href="#r25-97">97.</a> In some of the legends of Sigurd and Brynhilda, Brynhilda is
represented as lying asleep in a tower of glass, encompassed by a circle of
fire, through which Sigurd had to ride to wake her. In this story she
is the prototype of the Sleeping Beauty.</p>

<p><a href="#r25-157">157.</a> We often read in Russian folk-tales of revolving huts supported
on fowls' legs.</p>

<p><a href="#r25-159">159.</a> The favourite weapon of the Icelander Skarphedin, the son of
Njal, was a bell which rang out shortly before any person was to be
killed by it.</p>

<p><a href="#r25-169">169.</a> In the dales of Yorkshire it used to be considered very inhospitable
not to leave the door open at mealtimes.</p>

<p><a href="#r25-289">289, 290.</a> Saxony and Viro are Germany and Esthonia.</p>

<p><a href="#r25-564">564.</a> Apparently a sort of master of the ceremonies at Finnish

the Morning and Evening Twilight will be found in Jones and Kropf's
